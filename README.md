-----------------------------------------------
Instruction:

ex '!bd 2020/01/01'
-----------------------------------------------
Discription:
Just a small project that will tell you your birthdays that is on weekends, so you can plan ahead and invite your friends

From the year of users born, calculate the future 50 years, since there is no point of knowing the birthday that has been celebrate, today's date will be use to see if the birthday has happen before, so the results will be just the ones with the future until the user is 50 years old.

Why until 50 years old? I don't know, just think of users are half way to 100, pretty much seen almost everything they wanted.
I'm aware polish the code and make it look better and stuff, but that will be endless.
